Below we will define an `n`-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given `n`.

A `1`-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length `1`. An `n`-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the `n - 1`-interesting polygon and appending `1`-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the `1`-, `2`-, `3`- and `4`-interesting polygons in the picture below.
