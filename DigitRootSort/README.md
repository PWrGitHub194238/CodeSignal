Digit root of some positive integer is defined as the sum of all of its digits.

You are given an array of integers. Sort it in such a way that if `a` comes before `b` then the digit root of `a` is less than or equal to the digit root of `b`. If two numbers have the same digit root, the smaller one (in the regular sense) should come first. For example `4` and `13` have the same digit root, however `4 < 13` thus `4` comes before `13` in any digitRoot sorting where both are present.
