You are given an array `parent` of length `n` specifying a tree. The vertices of the tree are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `parent[i]` is the parent of the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> node. The root of the tree is the vertex `v`, the parent of which is the same vertex (i.e. `parent[v] = v` if and only if `v` is a root).

What will the `parent` array look like if the edges remain the same but tree is rooted at the other vertex `newRoot`?
