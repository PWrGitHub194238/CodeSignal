A sequence of integers is called a zigzag sequence if each of its elements is either strictly less than all its neighbors or strictly greater than all its neighbors. For example, the sequence `4 2 3 1 5 3` is a zigzag, but `7 3 5 5 2` and `3 8 6 4 5` aren't. Sequence of length `1` is also a zigzag.

For a given array of integers return the length of its longest contiguous sub-array that is a zigzag sequence.
