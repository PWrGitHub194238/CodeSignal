Given a line segment `AB`, with a point `C` (such that `C` is not collinear with `A` and `B`), and a triangle `DEF`, your task is to form a parallelogram containing `A` and `B`, with area equal to `DEF`.

More specifically, your mission is to find points `G` and `H` that satisfy all below conditions:

* `H` lies on the ray formed by `AC` (ie: angle `CAB` is equal to angle `HAB`).
* `ABGH` is a Parallelogram.
* Area of parallelogram `ABGH` is equal to area of triangle `DEF`.

Return the coordinates of points `G` and `H`, rounded to `3` decimal places.
